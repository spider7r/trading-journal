IMPORTANT: TRADINGVIEW CHARTING LIBRARY PLACEHOLDER

When you receive the "Advanced Charts" files from TradingView (GitHub):

1. Copy the `charting_library` folder from their repository.
2. Paste it into this `public` folder.
3. You should end up with:
   - public/charting_library/charting_library.js
   - public/charting_library/bundles/...
   - public/datafeeds/... (if using their default datafeed)

do NOT rename the folder. It must be `charting_library`.
